<p>This demo runs smoother in Chrome.</p>
<div class="row">

<p>
    What you just experienced is a demo for a consulting project where I trained a model to detect nods.
    The model was created and trained in Pytorch and then ported to Deeplearn.js 
    to run in the browser.
</p>
<p>
    The green bar is the probability of a nod as inferred by the model. 
    When the bar extends past the black notch, we can be fairly certain that we have had a nod.
</p>
<p>
    There is a slight (~2s) delay between a nod and its detection.<br>
</p>

    More details to come â€¦
