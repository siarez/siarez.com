<p>Hello Deaplearn.js VAE!</p>



<h2>Inro</h2>
<p>
    If you are here, you probably know variational autoencoders are a different animal than vanilla autoencoders.
    It took me a while to get my head around them. The number of blog posts on the topic is itself evident that I wasn't alone in my struggle.
    In the end, what really helped me understand them, was this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4_Y5rsvi8" target="_blank">lecture by Ali Ghodsi</a> of University of Waterloo.
    He does an excellent job explaining the variational method and deriving all the mathematical formulas step by step.
    But he doesn't get to training and “reparameterization trick”.
</p>
<p>
    Since the network has random sampling at heart, it is at first not obvious how to do error backpropagation.
    “reparameterization trick” is a clever way of getting random sampling out of the error backpropagation path.
    To understand it, just compare the two graphs on the hero image on top of this page, after you've watched Ali Ghodsi's lecture.
</p>
<p>
    I guess you are here because I promised an iterative demo, so let's get to it.
</p>
<h2>Demos</h2>
<p>
    First a little bit about what you are seeing. <br>
    In my quest to understand VAEs, I coded one up from strach using PyTorch.
    (<a href="https://github.com/siarez/VAE" target="_blank">GitHub link here</a>)
    My script has a little function that saves model parameters (i.e. weights and biases) in a JSON file.
    I've used it to save the model parameters after training.
    Those parameters are now loaded into Deeplearn.js variables, and are used to create the interactive visualizations in this demo.
